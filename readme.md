# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## Week-09
### 1. Summary

Week nine of MART-341 allowed us to play with the technique of adding boxes, borders and different positioning capabilites within a webpage. A few key techniques we learnt this week were;

**padding**-padding is the distance created between content such as text from the box or boarder that contains the content.

**Margin**-Margins is the calculated space between a box/element and another element.

**Float**-Allows indicated elements to be displayed outside the normal flow of the content or webpage.

**Box Size**- Box size allow us to create the different boxes or elements that build up a webpage. It allows us to adjust width, height, colour, pixels, boarder thickness and design etc.

### Homework

This weeks homework I created a webpage that was meant to encourage people to about dogs and help them determine which dag breed would be best for them. For th webpage I included a title of the webpage along with the loga for the organization I was promoting within the webpage. I also include diffeent box models which helped me develop a tab bar which directed users to different webpages, also well as a drop-down menu give an individual the option to choose which sub-page they preferred to enter onto. This lay out was designed in a way to provide the neatest and most clear information that was user friendly and ultimaetly assissted users in a way that made the use ofthe website, quick, easy and aesticially pleasing to use. 

### Issues

This week I struggled quite a bit with the dropdown menu, however after multiple tries and lots of research and help from classmates I was able to figure it out and successfully add my drop-down menu :)

### Future Discussion

This week was another exiting week adding to my knowledge in creating webpages. I am beginning to see all the elements coming together, which is getting me closer and closer to a stage that where I am beginning to get comfortable creating webpages every week. I am exciting to continue working and practising.
