# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## Week-09
### 1. Summary

Week nine of MART-341 allowed us to play with the technique of adding boxes, borders and different positioning capabilites within a webpage. A few key techniques we learnt this week were;

**padding**-padding is the distance created between content such as text from the box or boarder that contains the content.

**Margin**-Margins is the calculated space between a box/element and another element.

**Float**-Allows indicated elements to be displayed outside the normal flow of the content or webpage.

**Box Size**- Box size allow us to create the different boxes or elements that build up a webpage. It allows us to adjust width, height, colour, pixels, boarder thickness and design etc.

### Homework

This weeks homework entailed creating a new webpage that displayed a parallax scrolling, hero imagery and background images. For my webpage I chose to create a webpage focusing on the theme of Missoula and Montana in general. I used multiple images of Montana as background and hero images to draw the viewers attention to the beauty of the landscape and used title words such as Missoula, Montana, wildlife and wilderness to give the viewers a initial understanding of what will be discussed throughout the webpage. For the parallax scrolling, I allowed the interchanging of photographs to appear along the screen as the viewer scrolls up and down the webpage.

### Issues

The most common issue I had this week was trying to get the hero photos to remain in the order that I wanted it to be, as well as getting the text to appear on top of the image in the position and size that I wanted.

### Future Discussion

Overall I really enjoyed this weeks assignment and it makes me really excited to get started on the final project and take the extra time to put in extra effort in building my own personalized webpage.
