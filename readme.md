# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## Week-09
### 1. Summary

Week nine of MART-341 allowed us to play with the technique of adding boxes, borders and different positioning capabilites within a webpage. A few key techniques we learnt this week were;

**padding**-padding is the distance created between content such as text from the box or boarder that contains the content.

**Margin**-Margins is the calculated space between a box/element and another element.

**Float**-Allows indicated elements to be displayed outside the normal flow of the content or webpage.

**Box Size**- Box size allow us to create the different boxes or elements that build up a webpage. It allows us to adjust width, height, colour, pixels, boarder thickness and design etc.

### Homework

This weeks homework entailed creating a new webpage that displayed a parallax scrolling, hero imagery and background images. For my webpage I chose to create a webpage focusing on the theme of Missoula and Montana in general. I used multiple images of Montana as background and hero images to draw the viewers attention to the beauty of the landscape and used title words such as Missoula, Montana, wildlife and wilderness to give the viewers a initial understanding of what will be discussed throughout the webpage. For the parallax scrolling, I allowed the interchanging of photographs to appear along the screen as the viewer scrolls up and down the webpage.

### Issues

This week I struggled quite a bit with the dropdown menu, however after multiple tries and lots of research and help from classmates I was able to figure it out and successfully add my drop-down menu :)

### Future Discussion

This week was another exiting week adding to my knowledge in creating webpages. I am beginning to see all the elements coming together, which is getting me closer and closer to a stage that where I am beginning to get comfortable creating webpages every week. I am exciting to continue working and practising.
